# iOS Interview Preparation
Curating all the resources **I refer to** for interview preparation. This is **not an exhaustive list** and you are free to add your suggestion to it. Thank you!

*Note: I have only interviewed with a single company [Apple] as of now. I researched a lot about iOS interviews in general, but my views may be biased, and may not be helpful for the dream company you are preparing for.*

You can find the list here - [iOS Interview Preparation](../blob/master/iOS INTERVIEW PREPARATION.md)
